## Commiting / Workflows

The linter / formatter is there to make the code fit within guidelines for readability.

- Find linting issues `dart analyze --fatal-infos` or apply them automagically `dart fix --apply`
- Format files `dart format .`
- Make sure your build actually compiles before pushing!
